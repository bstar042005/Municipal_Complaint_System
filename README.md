Municipal Complaint & Citizen Tracking System (MCCTS)
📌 Project Overview
The Municipal Complaint & Citizen Tracking System (MCCTS) is a role-based web application designed to streamline the process of registering, assigning, tracking, and resolving municipal complaints.

The system allows citizens to register complaints related to civic issues, admins to manage and assign complaints to workers, and workers to resolve assigned complaints. A built-in notification system ensures transparency and real-time updates for all roles.

This project is built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, and CSS, following secure session-based authentication and clean UI principles.

▶️ How to Run the Project
📘 Step 0: How the Project Works
This is a PHP–MySQL web application that runs on a local server using Apache and MySQL.  
We will use XAMPP to set up the environment.
🧩 Step 1: Download and Install XAMPP
XAMPP includes Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

Download from the official site:
https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

Install XAMPP with default settings and ensure Apache and MySQL are selected.
▶️ Step 2: Start Apache and MySQL
1. Open XAMPP Control Panel  
2. Click Start for Apache and MySQL  
3. Confirm both services are running  
🗄️ Step 3: Database Setup
Create Database
1. Open: http://localhost/phpmyadmin
2. Click New  
3. Create database: complaint_system
Import Database
1. Select complaint_system  
2. Click Import  
3. Choose complaint_system.sql  
4. Click Go  
All tables and relations will be created automatically.

📥 Step 4: Clone GitHub Repository
Navigate to XAMPP htdocs folder:

Windows:
C:\xampp\htdocs\

Linux/macOS:
/opt/lampp/htdocs/
Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/ViVan2706/Municipal_Complaint_System.git MCCTS
Your structure should look like:

htdocs/
└── MCCTS/
    ├── admin/
    ├── citizen/
    ├── worker/
    ├── LoginAndSignup/
    ├── db.php
    ├── complaint_system.sql
⚙️ Step 5: Configure Database Connection
Open db.php and set:

    $conn = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "", "complaint_system");
🌐 Step 6: Run the Project
Open browser and visit:

    http://localhost/MCCTS/LoginAndSignup/login.html
